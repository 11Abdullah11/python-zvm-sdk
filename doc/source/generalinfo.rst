Content of this package
========================

The zvm cloud connector package (also known as zvm sdk) is a client library
written in pure Python that interacts with `z/VM`_ SMAPI (System management API)
of `IBM Z`_ or `LinuxONE`_ machines. The goal of this package is to make the
z/VM SMAPI easy to be consumed by upper layer programmers and provide a set
of APIs to be called through RESTful interfaces.

.. _LinuxONE: http://www.ibm.com/systems/linuxone/
.. _z/VM: http://www.vm.ibm.com/

The z/VM SMAPI is the access point for any external tools to
manage the z/VM running on IBM Z or LinuxONE platform. It supports management of
lifecycle and configuration of various platform resources, such as Guest,
CPU, memory, virtual switches, Storage, and more.
